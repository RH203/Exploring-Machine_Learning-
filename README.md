# Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my machine learning journey repository! Here, I document my learning progress as I delve into the fascinating world of machine learning.

## About

In this repository, you will find the code, projects, and notes my journey learning machine learning. As I progress through the courses, I will be updating this repository with my assignments, projects, and any additional resources I find useful.

## Tech Stack

During my machine learning course, I'm utilizing the following tech stack:

- [Python](https://www.python.org): The primary programming language used for machine learning tasks and projects.
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/): My preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for writing, debugging, and running Python code.
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/): Anaconda is a Python distribution that bundles various packages and virtual environments for scientific computing and data analysis.

## Projects

As part of my learning journey, I will be working on various machine learning projects. Some of the projects I have completed or I am working on include:

<!-- - [Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing](#) - A project where I analyze sentiments from text data using NLP techniques.
- [Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](#) - Implementing CNNs to classify images into different categories. -->

- [Research Papers](#) - Academic papers on machine learning topics. -->

## Installation

To set up your environment for machine learning development, follow these steps:

1. **Download Anaconda:** Visit the official Anaconda download page at [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Follow Installation Instructions:** Follow the installation instructions provided by the Anaconda installer. Make sure to select the option "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" during the installation process.

3. **Install Required Packages:** After installing Anaconda, open a terminal or Anaconda Prompt and run the following commands to install the required packages:

```bash
conda install pandas jupyter numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras pytorch
